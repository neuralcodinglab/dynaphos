# About the project
A fully differentiable and biologically plausible simulation of cortical prosthetic vision, which can be used for end-to-end optimization.

## Installation
`pip install dynaphos`

## Getting Started
- Download the default configuration file (config/params.yaml) from [our repository](https://github.com/neuralcodinglab/dynaphos/) and adjust according to needs. 
- Run the `test` suite.
- See the `examples` directory for simple use cases.
